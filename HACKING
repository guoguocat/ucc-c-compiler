Overview
---------

The compiler (cc1) runs in three main stages - parse, fold and gen.

It operates on data structures described in tree.h, expr.h, stmt.h and data_structs.h

these are mainly:
	expressions: 5 + 2, f("hello"), x = y
	and
	statements:  if(...){...}, while, do, for

statements are of type "stmt", expressions are of type "expr"


Parsing (parse{,_type}.c)
-------------------------

Parsing simply constructs a syntax tree (tree.h + struct.h + typedef.h).
There are expressions and statements, shown in tree.h/expr.h/stmt.h

The parser for expressions is a recursive descent. It uses the tokeniser to convert the input into tokens.
This makes it easier to parse.
The string
	"2 + 'a' ^ 3"
is converted into the tokens:
	token_integer
	token_plus
	token_character
	token_xor
	token_integer

some tokens, such as _integer and _string come with extra data
These are available as follows:
	extern intval currentval [struct allowing use of longs and ints, describing signed or unsigned]
	char *token_current_spel()

The current token is available as follows:
	extern enum token curtok [parse.h]

the token enum is defined in tokenise.h

These are used from parse.c

when a data structure has been constructed, the parser calls EAT() or accept() with the token
is wants to step over, for example, EAT(token_character) will attempt to move to the next token,
discarding the current one, if it is a character. Otherwise an error is raised and the program exits.
accept() is similar, but doesn't abort the program. It returns true if the token was stepped over.


Folding (fold*.c, ops/)
----------------

Folding links up symbols, checks for [in]valid code (such as *(void *)0 = 5)
and calculates stack offsets, struct offsets and so on.

The main part of fold is propagating the type of an expression down through its tree,
assigning to tree_type.

e.g.
	int **a;
	a[5] + 2

is parsed to:

	plus(deref(plus(a, multiply(5, 8))), 2)

a[5] -> *(a + 5) -> *(a + 5)

pointer stepping is done during code gen, e.g. *(a + 5 * sizeof(int))

implicit casts are also inserted for type-correct code gen
(i.e. movq %eax, -8(%rbp) is incorrect - an up-cast is needed)

thus when the folding is complete, we get this:

<int *>plus(
		<int *>deref(
			<int **>plus(
				<int **>a,
				<intptr_t>cast(intptr_t, <int>5))),
		<intptr_t>cast(intptr_t, <int>2))


thus:
	- adding an <int *> and an <int> gives an <int *>,
	  but the int is cast to intptr_t, so it's the right size for addition to (int *)

	- dereferencing an <int **> gives an <int *>

this helps for type checking, etc


Code Generation (gen_asm.c / gen_str.c)
---------------------------------------

Code generation walks the tree, outputting a visual representation (gen_str) or
the x64 assembly (gen_asm).
gen_asm is highly suboptimal, see the asm_backend_recode/decl_init branches for
vast improvements.

This walks the statement and expression trees, generating code for each.
For example,

if(5 + 2)
  x(2, f() + 1);

has the tree representation:

if:
  expr: plus(5, 2)
  then:
    funcall: {
      func = "x",
      arg[0]: 2,
      arg[1]: plus(
        funcall: {
          func = "f",
        },
        1
      )
    }

a depth-first walk is done on the tree, generating the following stack code:

  push 5
  push 2
  add

  compare_to_zero
  branch_if_true "finish"

  call f
  push result
  push 1
  add
  push 2
  call x

  finish:

Of course, the compiler does constant folding, so expressions like plus(5, 2) are evaluated
at compile time.


This stack code is then taken by the code generator (out/*),
and turned into somewhat efficient assembly

e.g.

f() + a + 2;

|
|
v

call f // result implicitly on the stack
push a
plus
push 2
plus

|
|
v

callq f       // result in eax
addl a, %eax
addl 2, %eax


This is done by keeping the stack in memory as long as possible,
and only committing to generating instructions when needed, for example,
when an operation (+) is generated.

There is plenty of room for improvement, for example, storing offsets from symbols,
such as:

i = 10;
a[2 * i - 3] = 4;

can be the assembly:

movl $10, %ecx
movl $4, -0x3(%rdi, %rcx, 2)

assuming `a' is in rdi.


Data Structures
---------------------------------------

The expression data structre is pretty easy, an expression has a left and a right hand side, etc etc

The complicated bit is the type/decl structure.

I shall explain this when I get around to it.

e.g.
	const int ***x;
is represented as
	decl { .spel = "x", .type = { .primitive = int, .spec = const } }
		.decl_ptr
			.decl_ptr
				.decl_ptr

e.g.
	int y;
is represented as
	decl { .spel = "y", .type = { .primitive = int } }

e.g.
	int *const z;
is represented as
	decl { .spel = "y", .type = { .primitive = int } }
		.decl_ptr { .is_const = 1 }

e.g.
	int (*f)();
is represented as
	decl { .spel = "y", .type = { .primitive = int } }
		.decl_func { .funcargs = { } }
			.decl_ptr

e.g.
	int *(*g)(int, char);
is represented as
	decl { .spel = "y", .type = { .primitive = int } }
		.decl_ptr
			.decl_func { .funcargs = { int, char } }
				.decl_ptr


dereferencing a decl removes its lowest decl_ptr/leaf node.
in the case that we have:

int **x;
*x;

*x's decl looks like this:

decl { .spel = "x", .type = { .primitive = int } }
	.decl_ptr


int ***(*func_returning_lots)();
	decl { .spel = "func_returning_lots", .type = { .primitive = int } }
		.decl_ptr
			.decl_ptr
				.decl_ptr
					.decl_func { .funcargs = {} }
						.decl_ptr

dereferenced and called [ (*func_returning_lots)() ], becomes:
int ***;
	decl { .spel = "func_returning_lots", .type = { .primitive = int } }
		.decl_ptr
			.decl_ptr
				.decl_ptr


finally:

int *(*(*func_returning_fptr)(int))(char);
	decl { .spel = "func_returning_fptr", .type = { .primitive = int } }
		.decl_ptr
			.decl_func { .funcargs = { char } }
				.decl_ptr
					.decl_func { .funcargs = { int } }
						.decl_ptr
