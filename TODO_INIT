global/static init - broken, seems to think functions are everything

designated init + zero for the rest:
	int x[] = { [3] = 5 };
	struct { int x, y, z; } q = { .y = 2, 3 };

sizeof(int){} parsing

bugs:
	not enough space - unbraced/multiple.c
	missing tail init - array/brace.c
	struct/nested_array_of_arrays.c
