All types start at the base - int, short, struct, union, etc
We then get to other types with qualifiers, pointers, arrays and functions.
e.g.

int
\- typedef int int32_t
   \- int32_t get_int32(<reference to struct A *>)

char
\- const char
   \- const char *
	 	  \- const char *const

struct A
\- struct A [2]
\- struct A [10]
\- struct A []

Each array type is different if it has a different size.
