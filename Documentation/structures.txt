The expression data structre is pretty easy, an expression has a left and a
right hand side, etc etc

The complicated bit is the type/decl structure, documented in type_system.txt

Variables are represented by the "decl" struct, which is essentially a name and
a type:

int a;

decl = {
	.spel = "a",
	.ref = {
		.type = type_type,
		.bits.type = <"int" btype>
	}
}

Decls also hold information on things like bitfields and storage (static,
extern, typedef, etc).
