0-width bitfield

check for bitfield size > word size

crash on current bitfields/write.c test - seems to break on stack (vs pointer) structs

warn on constant-truncation via assignment to bitfield
	(+ const fold constant truncation/general backend const fold for constant ops?)

check for gcc-compat with bitfields where there's overflow,
	e.g.
	struct
	{
		int x : 30; // pad with :2
		int y : 30; // new field
	};
