1: deref_reg using the same register blows other functions' logic out the water
	see regression_deref.c

2: off_t (and others) seem to now be signed?
	see stdlib.c
		setle -> setg

3: adding to a global pointer adds zero
	see regression_add.c

4: register stack save code doesn't align to stack
	see stdio.c
		e.g. -41(rbp)
